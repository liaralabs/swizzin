# Changelog

## [1.1.0]

### December 28th, 2017

### Added

- [xmr-stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) xmr-stak-cpu has been deprecated. New dev fee minimum is 1.0. If you find this fee appaling, compile xmr-stak yourself and consider donating to the xmr-stak project.
- [The Lounge](https://thelounge.github.io/) - An IRC web client
- [nzbget](https://nzbget.net) - The most efficient usenet downloader (their words, not mine)
- [SickGear](https://github.com/SickGear/SickGear) - An alternative fork of SickRage/pyMedusa
- Standalone mode for Let's Encrypt -- run the installer as many times as you like
- grsec kernel removal to the initial setup and by `box rmgrsec` in the event you have an ovh server and would like to remove it (recommended for panel and xmr-stak)

### Changed

- autodl2.cfg has been deprecated in the autodl package, removed dependency upon this file.
- Fancyindex updated with a light and dark theme. Default to dark
- A few things in the way the panel handled nzbget/sickgear and added The Lounge
- rtorrent ExecStop method in systemd is now slightly more graceful than killall

### Fixed

- Certain cases where lib-fcgi might not have gotten installed
- An autodl update caused button overflow to the club-QuickBox theme which broke the filters tab
- New users weren't displaying passwords if automatically generated
- Jackett is no longer finicky about the trailing slash in its URI (/jackett)
- Certain conditional error logic might not have exited a script when it should have (e.g. Let's Encrypt)
- New users didn't have permission to manipulate their flood service with systemctl
- Bugs seemed to have wormed their way into the SickRage reverse proxy. This is fixed.

### Removed

- xmr-stak-cpu install script. The remove script has been left so that you may remove it before upgrading to xmr-stak

## [1.0.1]

### December 9th, 2017

### Added

- Update sub-scripts to fix errors that may be present in existing installs. Will take two runs of `box update` to run for the first time.
- Support for Ubuntu 17.10

### Fixed

- Updated dependencies for a few packages to prevent installation errors during minimal installs
- Fixed an issue in the QuickBox dashboard that prevented installed applications from appearing the service manager

## [1.0 Stable]

### November 18th, 2017

### Changed
- Flood now requires node-gyp to build
- ruTorrent now ships with a spectrogram plugin. sox is now installed as a dependency for ruTorrent

### Fixed
- `box chpasswd {user}` wasn't printing the password if it was generated randomly
- Certain fringe ruTorrent installs might not have a required dependency for geo-ip resolution

### November 13th, 2017

### Added
- ruTorrent now ships with a spectrogram plugin for analyzing audio files. Thus, installer now installs sox and applies the correct config for binary location

### Changed
- Default proxy addresses to 127.0.0.1 to avoid DNS resolution errors for localhost
- Fixed flood installer for new build steps
- `box help` is now a bit more helpful

### Fixed
- Subsonic install/reverse proxy issues

- Fringe scenarios in which quotas might not apply fstab edits correctly
- rtorrent download folder permissions for subusers
- libfcgi binary wasn't being installed on Debian 9 and newer Ubuntu versions
- `box upgrade plex` -- this command should not be run as root

## [1.0.0 Pre-Stable]

### October 9th, 2017

### Added
- php7.0-mbstring was missing from the nginx installer. This may have caused php errors in ruTorrent under rare circumstances.

### Changed
- Refactored keyserver calls for mono, sonarr and sabnzbd-extras repositories
- Removed python-software-properties in favour of allowing it to be marked for installation automatically with software-properties-common

### Fixed
- Certain do or die commands were missing parenthesis causing the exit to trigger unconditionally. These have been fixed.
- Removed reference to removed function _ruconf in scripts/install/rtorrent.sh
- `box panel fix-disk root/home` will now function properly again (the refactor of quickbox_dashboard left it non-functional)
- Quota installer may have failed due to the installer's inability to match a pattern. Pattern has now been expanded to include tab characters and should fix any issues.

### September 29th, 2017

### Changed
- Disabled HSTS in nginx SSL params. [Why?](https://github.com/liaralabs/swizzin/commit/5f9af8d3dea9ebd06fa072c322f8fa7b54b431b2)
- Moved swizzin PATH variables from bashrc to profile
- Moved panel installation script to nginx directory and left a wrapper in its place
- `box update` will now update the panel as well. In the event that `git reset HEAD --hard` fails to reset the panel repo to a pullable state, a backup and restore function will run.

### Fixed
- Updated Plex repository location
- Flood script cleanup
- box chpasswd was using an incorrect variable to insert the password into deluge-web hostlists
- rTorrent removal script had a syntax error
- Added a github mirror for xmlrpc-c in the event that SourceForge goes down for an extended period again
- Cleaned up the new GUIs function in the installer to ensure that the autodl plugin for ruTorrent installs properly if it should be installed
- Panel: lang_de script attempted to cat its config into the wrong file.
- Other minor fixes

## [1.0.0-RC2]

### September 21st, 2017

### Added
- Flood is now available!
  - If you have nginx installed, you can access it from the web at /flood. Otherwise, flood port will be printed upon install. Please note, SSL is not currently configured for non-proxied configurations. If you need SSL without nginx, you will have to configure it yourself.
  - Flood has a complimentary upgrade script. `box upgrade flood`
  - Please note that there are currently some bugs when using both Flood's authentication and nginx basic authentication. You might need to complete nginx authentication a couple times. Flood authentication will be disabled once the option exists. Until then there is no fix.
- box now has an upgrade function to run scripts in the scripts/upgrade directory
  - Current scripts: deluge, flood, nginx, ombi, plex, rtorrent, rutorrent
- Logoff plugin for ruTorrent

### Changed
- ruTorrent has been decoupled from the rTorrent installation. (run `box upgrade rutorrent` or `touch /install/.rutorrent.lock` if you already have ruTorrent installed.)
  - If you need ruTorrent please be sure to check both nginx and ruTorrent during the initial installation. A web interface will *NOT* be installed by default.
- rTorrent uninstall will now purge *ALL* related packages (ruTorrent and Flood). Be careful!
- Quickbox Dashboard has been rebased with the latest changes
- Made error for usernames with capital letters more noticeable.

### Fixed
- Let's encrypt script now checks for nginx before running
- Master user is now given sudo permission in setup.sh not install/rtorrent.sh (oops!)
- Upstreams in /etc/nginx/conf.d were not being removed if extra users were deleted
- Fixed a bad else statement in xmr-stak-cpu installer

  - plex ([updateplex](https://github.com/mrworf/plexupdate) by mrworf)
  - ombi
- Compile mktorrent from source for -s flag (19c823362fb69743a5b6178fecbedffb781ace74)

- Move stop/start functions in nginx configuration scripts to inside the script to support stand-alone install (for example, if you chose to install nginx after your initial install) (4d92eea4443e4d3f84f47e8df71bdc1a582ec27f)
- Under-the-hood improvements for box (475aadadd71d8ab4990607e4493e40ffbbe10423)
- Current subsonic version is now determined automatically (6be077e7fec1b62516086a1fe546a2d9595e8152)

### Fixed
